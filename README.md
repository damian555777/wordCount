This is a simple application that injests some text,
parses all alphabetic words and displays the count of
the words in a table format. There is also a button
which allows users to sort the table by the count of
the words in descending order or by the default
alphabetic sort.

- Some assumptions have been made:
  1 - Excluding all numeric values (dates)
  2 - Added a default alphabetic sort
  3 - Word counts are case sensitive
  4 - Ignore the count of empty strings
  5 - No need to create subcomponents, simple enough
